- It works like a database — but optimized for analytics.

##  Built for the Cloud
- Unlike old systems (on-prem servers), Snowflake runs fully in the cloud on:
- AWS
- Azure
- GCP

No physical servers to manage.

##  Delivered as a Service

It’s SaaS (Software as a Service).

That means:
- No installation
- No infrastructure management
- Scalable automatically
- Pay for what you use

# 📊 What is a Data Mart?

A **Data Mart** is a smaller, focused version of a Data Warehouse.  
It contains data for one specific department or business area.

---

## 🔹 Simple Definition

A **Data Mart** is a structured subset of data designed for a specific team, such as:

- Sales  
- Finance  
- Marketing  
- HR  

---

## 🔹 Example

Imagine a company has:

- Sales data  
- HR data  
- Finance data  
- Inventory data  

All of this is stored in a **Data Warehouse**.

Now:

- The **Sales team** only needs sales metrics.  
- The **HR team** only needs employee data.  

So we create:

- 📊 **Sales Data Mart**  
- 💰 **Finance Data Mart**  
- 👥 **HR Data Mart**

Each team gets only the data they need.

## 🔹 Data Warehouse vs Data Mart

| Data Warehouse | Data Mart |
|----------------|------------|
| Enterprise-wide | Department-specific |
| Large & complex | Smaller & focused |
| Stores all company data | Stores filtered data |
| Used by many teams | Used by one team |

---

## 🔹 In a Data Analyst Role

As a Data Analyst, you might:

- Query from a data mart using **SQL**
- Build dashboards from a **Sales Data Mart**
- Create KPIs using a **Marketing Data Mart**
- Use it as a clean, structured source for **Power BI**
