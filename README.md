#What is SnowFlake?
Snowflake – A full data warehouse built for the cloud
Snowflake is a modern cloud-based data warehouse designed specifically for analytics.


##  SQL Data Warehouse
- You query Snowflake using SQL.
Example:
SELECT SUM(sales)
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';

It works like a database — but optimized for analytics.

##  Built for the Cloud
Unlike old systems (on-prem servers), Snowflake runs fully in the cloud on:
AWS
Azure
GCP
No physical servers to manage.

##  Delivered as a Service
It’s SaaS (Software as a Service).
That means:
No installation
No infrastructure management
Scalable automatically
Pay for what you use

# Why Companies Use Snowflake
Companies like Best Buy use Snowflake because:
It handles huge data volumes
It separates storage and compute
Multiple teams can query at the same time
It integrates easily with:
Power BI
Tableau
Python
ML tools



EDW ⇒ Enterprise Data Warehouse ⇒ lice Oracle,SQL
What is a Data Mart?
A Data Mart is a smaller, focused version of a Data Warehouse.
It contains data for one specific department or business area.

🔹 Simple Definition
A data mart is a structured subset of data designed for a specific team, such as sales, finance, or marketing.

🔹 Example
Imagine a company has:
Sales data
HR data
Finance data
Inventory data
All of this is stored in a Data Warehouse.
Now:
The Sales team only needs sales metrics.
HR only needs employee data.
So we create:
📊 Sales Data Mart
💰 Finance Data Mart
👥 HR Data Mart
Each team gets only the data they need.

🔹 Data Warehouse vs Data Mart
Data Warehouse
Data Mart
Enterprise-wide
Department-specific
Large & complex
Smaller & focused
Stores all company data
Stores filtered data
Used by many teams
Used by one team


🔹 In a Data Analyst Role
You might:
Query from a data mart using SQL
Build dashboards from a sales data mart
Create KPIs using a marketing data mart
Use it as a clean, structured source for Power BI

Data Lake or Hoodup ⇒ like AWS
